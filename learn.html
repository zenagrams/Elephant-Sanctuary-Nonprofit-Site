                <p>Elephants are the only remaining members of the Probosscidea order of mammals. The order included the extinct wooly mammoth and American mastodon.<br>Elephants are a "keystone species." If a keystone species disappears through extinction or removal, the entire ecosystem would change drastically. Other species rely on the keystone species for survival.<br>Today there are three surviving elephants species:</p>

                            The majority of the elephants now living in captivity were captured from the wild before the age of two. Separation from their families and bonded social groups at a young age often negatively impacts their social development and behavior as adults.<br>
                        <br>
                            The Elephant Sanctuary continually works to assess the impact of captivity in evaluating the health, social and psychological wellbeing of individual Sanctuary elephants and in planning for their lifetime best care.<br>
                        <br>
                            Expansive, diverse habitats and appropriate social groupings have been shown to have a positive influence on an elephant’s overall health, both physically and mentally. An animal’s behavior is the standard for judging physical and psychological wellbeing. When given the opportunity, elephants will spend a great deal of time traveling, eating, and socializing.<br>
                        <br>
                            The Elephant Sanctuary currently provides safe haven and care to African and Asian elephants permanently residing in multiple different habitat areas on a 3,060-acre preserve of forest, ponds, and pasture in southwest Middle Tennessee.

                            The Sanctuary defines Protected Contact as: a system for managing elephants that uses positive reinforcement training as the primary method to modify behavior; the use of physical punishment is prohibited. Directing the positioning and movement of the elephant is achieved through the use of targets and positive reinforcement. Caregiver safety is achieved by elephant and Caregiver positioning relative to each other and to a barrier, which typically separates human and animal spaces.<br>
                        <br>
                            A fundamental aspect of The Elephant Sanctuary is the belief that elephants need access to other elephants, vast and diverse habitats, and the freedom of choice about decisions that affect them. Choices such as whom they spend time with and when, what, and where they eat, and when and where they sleep are choices that each elephant is free to make for itself.

                            The Sanctuary defines Behavioral Management as a pro-active approach to managing captive animals to provide the best care and the highest level of wellbeing. Diverse environmental enrichment and positive reinforcement training are two fundamental techniques. Consideration is given to operational procedures and facility issues that may impact behavior, and these are modified when necessary. Approaches are continually assessed and measured to determine if behavioral goals have been met and if methods for managing behaviors have been successful. A behavioral management approach has tremendous potential to directly and positively affect changes towards each elephant’s enhanced wellbeing.

            <img src="https://prodelephantsapp-001.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/App/Models/Elephant/images/000/000/002/large/Photo%20Of%20Sissy%20At%20The%20Elephant%20Sanctuary%20In%20Tennessee.jpg" alt="Sissy" width="550px" height="450px" class="sissy">
            <p>
                Sissy was born in 1968 and caught in Thailand as a calf, first appeared in the United States in 1969. Sissy was sold to the Frank Buck Zoo in Gainesville, Texas to replace the zoo’s recently deceased elephant, Gerry. There she survived being submerged underwater during a record flood, with only her trunk above water allowing her to breathe. Sissy moved from the Houston Zone to El Paso Zoo where the harsh treatment she was enduring at the hands of the keepers ended up being videotaped and leaked to the local press. The community spoke for her and asked for Sissy to be retired to the Elephant Sanctuary where she arrived in January 26 of 2000.<br>
            <br>
                In stark contrast to the elephant who was reported to show signs of anxiety and fear around water following her flood experience in Texas, Care Staff frequently observe Sissy splashing and swimming in the ponds, even in the rain. Sissy has the unique communication style of flipping the end of her trunk back and forth to make a “popping” sound. These “pops” are commonly heard when she is socializing or when there is some new enrichment device to interact with. Sissy is also recognizable by her long body, the rippling flap across the top of her ears, and the “freckled” effect on her face and ears. She is most often found exploring the “2nd Pipeline” area of the habitat or napping in the direct sun in “South Yard".
